# AppTracker

## Overview
Applications’ Control project, which is named “atracker”, is designed for measuring privacy risks in mobile apps on the Android operating system.

## Project Description
Privacy risks are related to applications that are installed on mobile phones and the Internet. This experiment analyzes which apps are used most and its network usage for Android devices. The experiment was tested with 3 different Android phones. All the applications in the phones accessed personal information in different ways. The main aim of the project is to control third-party applications on the Android operating system. Many third-party applications are trackers that include potentially privacy risks because there is no information about how they collect and store user data.

Application controls usage information of each app, how long it is used, and its network data usage in the device. Android provides developers to control the user’s usage of network resources. In the atracker application, it is been controlling how much data used when on Wifi and Mobile. With this approach, it is possible to report which application use the internet most depend on time. For instance, some applications can run on the background and send data to the application without any limitation. Atracker control how much data is used by different applications.

On the other hand, atracker application controls how long they are used. Android also gives an opportunity to that how long an application is used on the mobile phone. With using this issue, atracker is known that how much time a user spends in any application. A user can use any application without knowing how the application uses its data via a mobile application. Atracker determines whether an application is a third-party app or not.

### App Usage Tracker
App Usage Tracker is an application for the Android operating system. The application tracks what apps are getting used on the device. It does not require the internet permission. It monitors which apps are used often. It cleans older usage data regularly. However, it tracks app usage when only the application working in the background. In addition to this, the application shows usage statistics after installation that means for the first launch of the application the usage report will be empty. Uninstalled apps do not be shown in the usage report.
### System Panel App
System Panel App was created to solve the battery life problem that enabling the monitoring apps that run on background. It also monitors which versions of the application that the user uses. On the other hand, it requires ‘Internet Access’ and ‘Telephony/Read phone State’ permissions. In addition to this, the application is not free. To use this app, you must pay 16.99 TL.
### Instant
The application named ‘Instant’ track phone and app uses both for Android and iOS devices. It includes phone usage time for days instead of looking at your time in individual apps. It requires a premium subscription and cost is $2 per month.
